<p>This Flash Demo is a Menu for a set of documents that no longer exist.</p>
<p>The purpose for this Flash Demo originally was to serve as an animated Menu for a set of documents.</p>
<p>At this time you may notice the various documents that once existed have been replaced by some rather simple HTML pages that simply state who created the Flash Demo.</p>
<p>Back when this Flash Demo was originally created each of the documents listed in the Menu did exist and were completely functional.</p>
<p>Notice the various mouse-over effects that can be seen whenever the mouse is hovered over certain menu items.</p>
