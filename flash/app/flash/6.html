<p>This Flash Demo is a rather complex menu with some URLs that do not work.</p>
<p>Please ignore the non-functional URLs - these URls did work once upon a time but now this is simply a static demo with some URLs that no longer work.</p>
<p>Also please ignore the fact that this Demo seems to advertise a video game because it did way back whenever this work was originally completed.</p>
<p>The purpose for this Demo is to show the complex nature of the work the author was able to perform to make this complex Menu come to life.</p>
