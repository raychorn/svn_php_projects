<p>This is a very simple bit of content that serves as a Demo for some Flash work that was done over the last going on 10 years.</p>
<p>As you may or may not be aware there is also a bit of tricky JavaScript code that supports this Demo page.</p>
<p>When you click on a link above you may notice two separate IFRAME objects are being populated with content.  Typically a single HTML ANCHOR can be made to populate one IFRAME at a time however through the magic of JavaScript I was able to populate two IFRAME objects based on each individual ANCHOR click.</p>
<p>Kindly ignore the minor imperfections or technical glitches you may notice while viewing these Flash Demos.  The idea here was to show the kind of work the author can do for you but not to show polished Flash applets that work as they were originally designed to work since some of these Flash Objects were created some time ago for contexts of deployment that no longer exist.</p>
