<p>This Flash Demo is a complete applet that was constructed using Flex 1.5.</p>
<p>As you can see this Flex Demo uses a lot of ActionScript.  Notice the complex operations being performed by the various Flash widgets.</p>
<p>Entry fields are being populated programmatically.  Passwords have been encrypted and are not being shown; this helps to maintain the security of the underlying system.  Listbox selections are being used to populate Entry fields. Zipcode Entry Fields are being validation to ensure only certain characters can be typed by the end-user.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of programmatic interactions between various Flash widgets that could only be accomplished through the use of ActionScript.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that it is also possible to reuse traditional JavaScript code within a Flash object because ActionScript is the same as JavaScript for the version of Flex and Flash that was used for this Demo.</p>
