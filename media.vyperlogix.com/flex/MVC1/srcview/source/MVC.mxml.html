        This MVC Sample features a full-blown Model View and Controller.
        
        Compare this code to MVC Sample #2 to see how much more code was required
        to make this Application Model functional.
        
        Try to imagine how much more code your developers will have to produce
        when using this approach and how much more expensive an effort would
        have to be if every single developer was using a stright-up MVC 
        programming pattern.  More than 50% of the development time would have
        been spent on building the Singletons for the controller classes before
        considering the debugging overhead.
        
        Also keep in mind even with MVC every single Controller is going to be
        bound to the Application such that these Controllers cannot be reused
        for multiple projects unless the same business logic and every other
        function was duplicated across projects.  The same thing holds for the
        views that will be unique for each project.  
        
        Code reuse comes into play when common code modules are required from
        project to project.  Common widgets are beneficial.  Common widget
        event handlers are beneficial.  And common Model objects can also be
        beneficial to a degree.
        
        Views will invariable be different from a high-level perspective.
        
        Also take into consideration the fact that every single senior
        developer I have ever talked with has balked at the idea of using
        MVC when there is no clear benefit in using this approach versus
        the one outlined in MVC Sample #2.
        
        Better to invest one&apos;s time in leveraging code reuse where possible and
        keep the level of development as light as possible lest one ends-up 
        spending more money than one wanted to for each effort only to find
        oneself with a ton of code for each project with little functionality
        to show for the effort.
