The Workbench is a web-based application that gives Salesforce administrators
on-demand access to useful tools to manage their organization. Combining and extending the power of both
the Apex DataLoader with the Apex Explorer, the Workbench can insert, upsert, update,
query, search, delete, undelete, and purge data as well as describe the metadata of any object in your Force.com organization.

<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>
The Workbench is built on PHP and connects to the Force.com API using SOAP-based web services. As such, 
to install and run the Workbench, you must have a working web server, such as Apache HTTP Server, with 
support for PHP. Follow the instructions below to install Apache HTTP Server, PHP, and the Workbench:

<ol>
<li>
	Easier
		<ul>
			Install a LAMP/WAMP bundled installation of Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, and PHP. For a list of WAMPs, please see 
			the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WAMPs">Comparison of WAMPs</a>. The Workbench has been known
			to work with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webdeveloper/">Web Developer Server Suite</a>.
		</ul>
	Manual
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Install Apache HTTP Server from <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">http://httpd.apache.org/</a></li>
			<li>Install PHP 5.x+ from <a href="http://www.php.net">http://www.php.net</a></li>
			<li>Ensure that PHP is registered with your Apache HTTP Server to handle .php files. The following lines
			should be in  <span class='mono'>&lt;your_apache_dir&gt;\conf\httpd.conf</span> file:<p/>	
				
<pre>
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
LoadModule php5_module "&lt;your_apache_dir&gt;/php5apache2.dll"

# AddType
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

# Anywhere
PHPIniDir "&lt;your_apache_dir&gt;/php5"
</pre>
				
			</li>
		</ol>
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	Ensure that PHP works on a basic level:
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Create a file called phpinfo.php in your web server's document root directory and paste the following into the file:<br/>
		<pre>&lt;?php phpinfo();&nbsp;?&gt;</pre></li>
		<li>Access the in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost/phpinfo.php. You should be presented with a page of PHP information about the current stage of PHP.
		If you did not, there is a problem with configuration of either your web server or PHP.</li>

	</ol>		
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	PHP 5 includes two .ini files to be used as templates for configuration. Rename php.ini-recommended to php.ini
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	Search for the string "extension_dir" in php.ini. Uncomment it and set it equal to "<your_php5_dir>/ext/". PHP requires an explicit path to find your extensions under Windows.
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	In order to use the HTTPS protocol and other features of Workbench, you need to edit some of the configurations in your php.ini file:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Search for "extension=php_curl.dll". There should be a semi-colon in front of that line - remove it to enable the extension.</li>
			<li>Scroll down and find "extension=php_openssl.dll" and do the same.</li>
			<li>Now scroll down a bit further and find "extension=php_sockets.dll". Leave this line alone, but insert a new line below it and type "extension=php_soap.dll" on that line.</li>
			<li>Search for "magic_quotes_gpc" and ensure that it is "Off" (Optional, but recommended)</li>
			<li>Search for "file_uploads" and ensure that it is "On"</li>
		</ol>
	<p/></li>
		
	<li>
	Now you need to copy the SSL library files from the PHP installation directory to your Windows system directory. The two files are libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll. They need to be copied into the system directory, usually c:\windows\system32 on an XP system. If you happen to have OpenSSL already installed on your computer you may find that these files are already installed. If they are, you should only replace them if the ones from the PHP directory are more recent. Change the extensions on the existing ones by adding '.bak' just to be safe.

    Note: these files must be readable by the Apache process, which may not run with the same permissions that you have when you copy the file into system32, please check that these are read and executable by world/all users 
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	You'll need to add the PHP installation directory to your system path. Right-click on My Computer on your desktop (or in the Start menu) and select 'Properties'. Click on the Advanced tab and then the 'Environment Variables' button. Scroll down in the System variables list until you find 'Path'. Select it and click the 'Edit' button. Click at the end of the string and make sure that the rest of the string is not highlighted. Type ";c:\php" at the end of the existing string and click OK until all of the windows are closed.
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	Restart your web server and re-load your phpinfo.php file to ensure it is still working.
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	Download and unzip the Workbench zip file into your web server's document root.
	<p/></li>
	
	<li>
	Point your web browser to https://localhost/workbench and you should be redirected to the Workbench
	login page, where you can login using your salesforce.com username and password.
	<p/></li>
	
    <li>
	To optionally configure the Workbench, system-wide changes can be made in the config.php file by an administrator who has access
	the the web server root (not from a web browser). The administrator can also allow end-users to override the defaults set in the config.php
	file by using the Settings page in the application in their web browser. Please see the instructions in the config.php file for details.
	<p/></li>
